# learn-x86-assembly

This repository contains example code to learn x86 assembly programming.

For quick environment setup, it's strongly recommended to use the docker image: johnnyb61820/linux-x86-assembly.

Here are the steps you may follow to set up this docker image:
1) docker pull johnnyb61820/linux-x86-assembly
2) docker run -it --name x86 -d johnnyb61820/linux-x86-assembly
3) docker exec -it x86 bash

If everything went fine, after step 3 above, you'll be inside the docker container and can create 
x86 assembly programs, assemble, link and run them. 

Happy learning !
